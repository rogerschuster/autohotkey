# Autohotkey
## Collection of Autohotkey scripts

Some scripts in the [Autohotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) programming language. I use them mostly to change the assignment of important keys on my
keyboard, i.e. to make frequently used functions more easyly accessible. They are most useful for persons working with keyboards with ISO-de layout AKA "QWERTZ".
